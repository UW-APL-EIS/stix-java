/**
 * Test cases for converting STIX package objects to and from JSON
 * strings.  The STIX package objects are created by loading from
 * sample STIX documents in our 'sample set', as distributed by Mitre.
 *
 * {@link https://stix.mitre.org/language/version1.1.1/samples/stix1.1.1-samples-all.zip}
 *
 * Note: Given the complexities of the various sample documents, there
 * is NO guarantee that these objects (which conform to the STIX
 * schema) can be represented/exchanged in json format.  They can of
 * course be represented/exchanged in xml form.  This 'json-ification'
 * of STIX obects was a purely academic exercise, essentially to
 * convince myself that the json would <em>not</em> work. Laugh!
